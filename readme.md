# DevSecOps for Beginners Course

This course is meant for those who are new to DevSecOps and would like to
learn some basic tools and principles that can be used to automate the
deployment of an application end-to-end. This course will start with local setup
and software requirements like Git and IntelliJ then will move into launching an
AWS instance using Terraform, then using Ansible to provision this instance, and
finally to automating this process with Jenkins.
